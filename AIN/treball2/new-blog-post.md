# Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems
A multi-agent system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for individual agents to solve on their own. In this blog, we will explore the concept of multi-agent systems and provide a list of useful resources for further learning.

## What are Multi-Agent Systems?
Multi-agent systems consist of multiple AI agents working collectively to perform tasks on behalf of a user or another system. These agents can be specialized in different areas, such as natural language processing, computer vision, or decision-making. By combining the strengths of individual agents, multi-agent systems can achieve complex goals that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to accomplish.
